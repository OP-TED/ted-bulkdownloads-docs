== Two Search modes available

The Search API offers two search modes:

=== Pagination mode, which allows the retrieval of up to 15000 notices for a given query, using pagination.

==== Limits:
* Maximum number of retrievable notices: 15k.
* Maximum number of notices per page: 250.
* Maximum number of fields per page: 10k.

If a limit is reached, the search API will return an error.

=== Iteration (scroll mode):

Allows the retrieval of all notices for a given query, without limitations. With this mode, the user calls the search API to retrieve the first result page and a token. This token can then be included in the next query sent to the search API to retrieve the next result page.


==== Limits:
* Maximum number of notices per page: 250.
* Maximum number of fields per page: 10k.

If a limit is reached, the search API will return an error. There is no limit on the number of retrievable notices
